I implemented the GAN on CIFAR dataset.
No of Epochs = 10000

Properties of the CIFER dataset
	Dimensions of the input image = (32 * 32 * 3)
	Number of the images = 60000
	Number of the class = 10

Latent dimension = (1 * 100)
This is the noise that we give as input to the generator

Learning of Activation function (LeakyReLU), Learning rate = 0.2
momentum = 0.8
Optimizer = Adam
